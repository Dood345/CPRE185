The complier did weird stuff and kept the program open in the BG when I pressed ctrl+z on it accidentally, looked like it had shut down the program but it had not.

I found out that I had somehow created an infinte loop with:
		if (close_enough(.25, -1, ay)) {
			if (checkPosition(position)) {
				printf("Bottom\n");
			}
			position = 2;
		}
and

int checkPosition(int newPosition) {
	if (newPosition == oldPosition) {
		int oldPosition = 0;
		return 1;
	}
	else if (newPosition != oldPosition) {
		oldPosition = newPosition;
		return 0;
	}
}

which upon further review shouldn't of output anything

wound up changing it to 

int checkPosition(int newPosition) {
	if (newPosition == oldPosition) {
		return 0;
	}
	else if (newPosition != oldPosition) {
		oldPosition = newPosition;
		return 1;
	}
}

and had to define int oldPosition = 0; outside of the function so that it would retain the previous value and not be reset each time the function is called. 
Had some help from JT
